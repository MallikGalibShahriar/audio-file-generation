# Step 1: Set up your environment
Before you begin, ensure you have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

# Step 2: Create a project folder
Create a new folder where you want to store your audio files. For example, you can create a folder named "audio_generation."

# Step 3: Create and set up the Python script
Open a text editor (such as Notepad on Windows or any code editor of your choice like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook).
Copy the Python script and paste it into your text editor.
Save the script with a .py extension. For example, you can save it as generate_audio.py inside your project folder.

# Step 4: Open a terminal or command prompt in that folder
Open a terminal or command prompt on newly created folder. You'll use this to run the Python script.

# Step 5: Run the Python script
Now, you can run the Python script by entering the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

python generate_audio.py
This command will execute the script and start generating audio files in the "audio_samples" folder within your project directory.

# Step 7: Monitor progress
The script will generate audio files one by one, and you'll see messages in the terminal indicating the progress, such as "File 1/50000 created," "File 2/50000 created," and so on.

                 That's it! You've successfully generated audio files using my Python script.
